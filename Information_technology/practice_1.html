		<h2>How to make a Banana smoothie?</h2>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Use at least one frozen ingredient in your smoothie. Frozen fruit or veggies, such as cauliflower, help to thicken and chill your smoothie.</li>
			<li>Err on the side of using less liquid to begin with. You can always add more liquid to get to your desired consistency.</li>
			<li>Begin blending on low speed and increase to higher speed as the smoothie starts to blend together.</li>
			<li>Don’t overfill the blender. If you are making a double or triple batch of smoothies to feed a crowd, start by adding only part of the frozen ingredients. Then add more once you get the first addition blended smooth</li>
			<li>As you blend, you may have to occasionally stop and stir, shake, or use your blender’s tamper to mix the ingredients. Sometimes you can get an air bubble at the bottom that prevents the blender from mixing the smoothie.</li>
			<li>If you make smoothies often, a high powered blender can save you time and effort.</li>
